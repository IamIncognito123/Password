# Password Generator

## Description

This project creates a random password generator based on conditions set by the user. The user chooses the password length,
whether they want uppercase letters, numbers or special characters. The user input must fit the criteria or an alert prevents them from moving forward.

I utilize a variety of tools and advanced knowledge in javascript to build a button with various conditions to create a random password.

## Installation
